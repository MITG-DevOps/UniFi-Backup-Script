# Unifi-Backup-Script-Selenium
Backup script for Unifi OS and network settings using Selenium

First time using selenium so if I'm doing something poorly that's probably why

# How to use
Follow the example.device_information.py file on how to create dictionary of device information

Once this is created, run `python unifi_backup.py` and follow instructions in command prompt
